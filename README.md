# MyReads Project

This project is part of React Developer Nanodegree provided by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/). It is a bookshelf app that allows users to select and categorize books they have read, are currently reading, or want to read.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

This project requires Node.js and Node Package Manager (NPM) to be installed locally.

## Local Development Environment

Clone this repo on your machine, navigate to its location in the terminal and run `npm install` command to install dependencies. Start the development server with `npm start`.

# Backend Server

A back-end server provided by Udacity was used to develop against. The [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) file contains the methods available to perform necessary back-end operations.

# Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the only terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
